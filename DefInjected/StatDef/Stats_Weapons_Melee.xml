  <!-- EN: Mitigation effect on damage taken by a weapon when used to parry an attack.\n\nFirst, the type of the attack is checked. If the attack compares against apparel blunt armor, then this value is multiplied by 1.5 and is treated as MPa, otherwise it is unchanged. Then the value is compared against the attack's armor penetration, with deflection occurring if toughness is the higher stat. Otherwise, damage is reduced based on the ratio of toughness to AP and a base reduction of 50% (e.g: if a 8mm RHA toughness weapon is hit by a 10mm RHA and 20 MPa attack from another weapon, the weapon will take 10% damage from the sharp part of the attack and 12.5% from the blocked blunt part of the attack). The internal formula can be approximated to:\n\nSharpDamageTaken = InitialSharpDamage * (1 - ToughnessRating / InitialSharpAP) / 2 \nBlockedBluntAP = InitialBluntAP * ToughnessRating / InitialSharpAP\nBluntDamageTaken = BluntDamageFromBlockedBluntAP * (1 - ToughnessRating / BlockedBluntAP * 1.5) / 2\n\nFor blunt attacks, anything related to sharp in the formulas can be ignored. -->
